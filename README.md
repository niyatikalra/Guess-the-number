# Guess-the-number
This project is a simple JavaScript-based "Guess the Number" game that allows users to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 100. The user gets 10 chances to guess the correct number. The game provides feedback after each guess, indicating whether the guessed number is higher or lower than the randomly generated number.
